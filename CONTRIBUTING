How to contribute to *silx*
---------------------------

This document describes how to contribute to the *silx* project. 
The process is similar to many other open-source project like *numpy*, just lighter as the project is smaller, so you won't be surprized with the pipeline.
*scikit-image* provides a nice tutorial `https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.txt` 


1. Create you GitHub account `https://help.github.com/categories/setup/` 
   and upload your SSH keys

2. Fork the silx project from `https://github.com/silx-kit/silx/`. 
   The button is on the top right of the page.

3. Clone your github version locally on the computer you intent to work on. 
   **git clone git@github.com/user/silx**

4. Make the silx test pass on your computer, using the **python3 run_tests.py**. 
   You may install the dependencies defined in *requirement.txt*

5. Open an issue in `https://github.com/silx-kit/silx/issues` to inform the 
   maintainer of your intentions.

6. Create a local branch to start working on your issue **git branch my_feature**

7. Code, enjoy, but ensure the new code is tested and does not break 
   the current test-suite.

8. Push your local branch to your github account: **git push origin my_feature**

9. Create a pull request (PR) from your feature-branch on github to trigger 
   the review process. Indicate this PR is related to the issue you opened in 5.

10. Discuss with the maintainer who is reviewing your code using the github interface.

If you encounter any problem or have question on how, you can also ask in the issue page.
